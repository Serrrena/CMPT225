 * size and head variables).  In this case this would NOT CREATE A
 * NEW LIST, just a new reference to one list.  It is therefore
 * necessary to write a constructor that makes a DEEP COPY.*/

/* Also note the parameter.  C++ functions use pass-by-value by
 * default.  This means that the functions make copies of the given
 * arguments.  This is inefficient (particularly for large objects).
 * Therefore it is normal to pass the address (using &) of the parameter,
 * but, if the parameter should not be changed, it is good practice to 
 * make it const, which prevents it from being changed.*/

 * Destructors are identified by the '~' preceding the class name.  There can

/* Note that there is some debate about whether or not this type of

 * shouldn't be responsible for its own display as it cannot foresee
 * how it is to be displayed. 
 * 
 * A better solution to this is provided by Java, which allows a class
 * to declare a "toString" function, which converts an object of the class
 * to a human-readable string.  (Specifically, human-readable.  Not program-
 * readable.)  This solves the problem--a class knows how to display itself
 * *as a string*.  It also removes the troublesome references to "cout" in
 * the routine below.  One should be able to write one routine that works
 * on cout, on cin, and on any output stream (such as the file streams we
 * created in Lab 0).
 *
 * One can easily implement "toString" in C++, but that involves String
 * manipulations, which we haven't covered yet.
